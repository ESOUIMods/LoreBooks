## Shalidor Data Syntax

format: (table) `{` Normalized Coordinates X`,` Normalized Coordinates Y`,` collectionIndex`,` bookIndex`,`Map ID`,`Location Details `}`

- Map ID:
  - Map Id used to get the Map Name
- Location Details: (table)
  - nil or false = default
  - 1 = on town map
  - 2 = Delve (SI CONST)
  - 3 = Public Dungeon (SI CONST)
  - 4 = under ground
  - 5 = Group Instance (SI CONST)
  - 6 = Inside Inn
  - 7 = Guest Room
  - 8 = Attic Room
  - 9 = Hidden Basement
  - 10 = Bookshelf
  - 9999 = Breadcrumb so don't add to right click menu
  - ld = { X } where X is the arbitrary key for the location details
  - `["ld"] = { 6, 7 }`, "Inside Inn" and "Guest Room" would be added to the Tooltip for the details

NOTE: (SI CONST): Means it is an ingame localization and doesn't have to be translated
